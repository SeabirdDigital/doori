			text: "It all started in 2021 when a friend and I decided to try renting a small food truck over the summer. We drove around Skåne to show what the Korean kitchen has to offer. Very quickly we had an answer: Korean food was really appreciated and Korean Fried Chicken was undoubtedly the favorite dish!<br><br>By the next summer we had found the smallest restaurant we could find in Helsingborg and after twelve days of intensive fixing and sweeping we had opened our first restaurant!<br><br>Since then, things have gone at breakneck speed and you can now find our Korean Fried Chicken in Lund, Trelleborg, Höganäs, Växjö and in Malmö. At the time of writing, we are also just opening our very first franchise outside of Helsingborg, located at Bergsgatan 15 in Malmö, welcome there!<br><br>With a small business, we have a big mission: to spread the joy of well-prepared authentic Korean food to as many people as possible. Most people don't know what Korean food tastes like, so come in and try our food and feel free to follow us on our exciting journey."
