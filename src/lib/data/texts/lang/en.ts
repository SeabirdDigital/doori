This, together with our homemade sauces and other dishes, we have just made available through our virtual kitchens in Malmö, Lund, Trelleborg, and Växjö so that our customers can order food online for deliveries (on foodora) and take away.<br><br>One of the main reasons we started Doori was to spread joy and make it easy for our customers to enjoy really good Korean food. We therefore continue to expand to different parts of Skåne.<br><br>Follow us on Instagram and join us on our exciting journey!"
